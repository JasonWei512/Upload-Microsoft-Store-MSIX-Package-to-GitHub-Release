[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/JasonWei512/Upload-Microsoft-Store-MSIX-Package-to-GitHub-Release?label=Release)](https://github.com/JasonWei512/Upload-Microsoft-Store-MSIX-Package-to-GitHub-Release/releases/latest)

A GitHub action to download the latest MSIX packages from Microsoft Store and upload them to an **existing** GitHub release with corresponding tag. 

For example, if the latest Microsoft Store package version is `1.2.3.0`, it will upload MSIX packges to a GitHub release with one of the following tags:

- `1.2.3.0`
- `1.2.3`
- `v1.2.3.0`
- `v1.2.3`


# Quick Start

Add a YAML file to `.github/workflows/upload-store-msix-to-release.yml` :

```yaml
name: Upload store MSIX to release

on: 
  release:  
    types: [released]   # Run the action when a GitHub release is published

  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 */6 * * *'  # Run the action every 6 hours

  workflow_dispatch:    # Manually run the action

jobs:
  upload-store-msix-to-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Upload store MSIX to release
      uses: JasonWei512/Upload-Microsoft-Store-MSIX-Package-to-GitHub-Release@v1
      with:
        store-id: 9NF7JTB3B17P
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        asset-name-pattern: AppName_{version}_{arch}  # Optional
```


# Action Inputs

- ## `store-id`

  The ID of the Microsoft Store app you want to upload, e.g. `9NF7JTB3B17P`.

  To get the app ID:
  - Open Microsoft Store and go to the app page.
  - Click the share button and select "copy link".   
  - A url like `https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NF7JTB3B17P` will be copied to clipboard. 
  - The last segment is the app ID.

- ## `token`

  The GitHub token to use. Just set it to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` for most cases. 

  GitHub will automatically create a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret when the action runs.

- ## `asset-name-pattern` (Optional)

  The pattern of the uploaded GitHub release asset's name without file extension. Can contain `{version}` and `{arch}`. 

  For example, for pattern `AppName_{version}_{arch}`, the uploaded asset's name can be `AppName_1.2.3.0_x64.Msix`.

  If you don't specify an `asset-name-pattern`, the default file name from Microsoft Store will be used. For example, `14463DeveloperName.AppName_1.2.3.0_x64__23j36sa9jtp8y.msix`.


# Why would you use it

If you publish apps to Microsoft Store and love open source, you may want to upload Microsoft Store-signed MSIX packages to GitHub release, like [Ambie](https://github.com/jenius-apps/ambie), [NanaZip](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip), and [Energy Star X](https://github.com/JasonWei512/EnergyStarX) do. 

Users can double click these packages to install them. No need to *install certificates to Trusted Root Certification Authorities with admin privilege* like for self-signed packages.

While the user experience is great, the developer experience is not. Every time you create a new release, you have to manually download the MSIX packages from Microsoft Store using https://store.rg-adguard.net and upload them to GitHub release.

So I created a GitHub action to automate this workflow.
